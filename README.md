## df.to_csv gives all data in 1 column? Pandas - Excel problem
It is possible to export results from Python (Pandas) to Excel using comma-separated values (csv). For instance, if your results are stored in a Pandas DataFrame denoted df, the data frame can be exported using df.to_csv. When you try to access the results in Excel, you might notice that all data are put together into a single column (depends on your setup). This video shows you how to fix that. Thanks, Ivan for suggesting this problem!

## How to do a Regression Analysis in Excel?
I demonstrate how to conduct a regression analysis in Excel. I show you how to activate the add-in needed to run the data analysis tools. Then we analyse the data and interpret the regression output. Fitted values can be visualised, and the distribution of residuals is derived. Finally, we discuss the limitations of Excel in dealing with missing values. Data are in the folder Regression Analysis.
