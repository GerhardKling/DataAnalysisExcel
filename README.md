# Data Analysis in Excel

## Getting started with Excel for Data Analysis
This video demonstrates some basic Excel skills, including (1) cell references, (2) functions, and (3) data visualisation. We analyse McDonald's sources of revenue growth using descriptive analysis.

## df.to_csv gives all data in 1 column? Pandas - Excel problem
It is possible to export results from Python (Pandas) to Excel using comma-separated values (csv). For instance, if your results are stored in a Pandas DataFrame denoted df, the data frame can be exported using df.to_csv. When you try to access the results in Excel, you might notice that all data are put together into a single column (depends on your setup). This video shows you how to fix that. Thanks, Ivan for suggesting this problem!

## How to do a Regression Analysis in Excel?
I demonstrate how to conduct a regression analysis in Excel. I show you how to activate the add-in needed to run the data analysis tools. Then we analyse the data and interpret the regression output. Fitted values can be visualised, and the distribution of residuals is derived. Finally, we discuss the limitations of Excel in dealing with missing values. Data are in the folder Regression Analysis.

## Calculate Your Maintenance Calories Using Regression
In this video, I will show you how to calculate your individual maintenance calories using a regression in Excel. You do not have to worry about fancy stats, as the Excel file will do all the magic for you. The file is available to download for free. You find many general-purpose calculators online that determine your maintenance calories. A very simple formula refers to your weight in pounds times 15. These general-purpose calculators are not very useful. My approach uses your individual data on weight and calorie consumption to predict your maintenance calories.

## How to create and write Excel files using Python?
This video provides a brief introduction to the xlsxwriter module. This module can be used to create and write Excel files using Python. First, we create a virtual environment and install the module. Second, we create a financial model in Python, focusing on parameters, values, and formulas.

## Event Study: Main Ideas
We introduce Event Studies, which are used to quantify the impact of events on firms' value. We discuss estimation and event windows as well as normal returns. The latter is based on the constant-mean-return model and the market model.

## Event Study: Measuring Anormal Returns
We measure abnormal returns and derive their statistical properties. This video goes deep into the theory of event studies. Enjoy more than 40 minutes of content with lots of vectors and matrices.

## Event Study: Test Statistics
This video derives confidence intervals for cumulated abnormal returns (CARs), which are used in event-studies. We discuss the underlying theory in detail and implement the theory using Excel.

## Event Study: Excel Model
This video discusses the implementation of a constant-mean return model in Excel. We calculate confidence intervals for cumulated abnormal returns (CARs), which are used in event studies.
